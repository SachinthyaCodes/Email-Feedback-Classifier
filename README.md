convert below text into markdown (README file for github)---># 📬 Email Feedback Classifier & Sentiment Analyzer (NLP + Transformers)

This beginner-friendly project classifies email feedback into types like **complaints**, **praise**, or **feature requests**, and analyzes **sentiment** using both **rule-based** and **transformer-based** techniques.

💡 Built as a learning experiment using NLP, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, and VADER.

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-feedback-classifier.git
cd email-feedback-classifier
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
🚀 How to Use
Step 1: Preprocess Raw Data
bash
Copy
Edit
python data_preprocessing.py
Cleans text (lowercase, punctuation removal)

Tokenizes

Encodes labels

Saves feedback_cleaned.csv

Step 2: Train a Baseline Classifier (Logistic Regression)
bash
Copy
Edit
python train_logistic_regression.py
Uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Displays accuracy and confusion matrix

Step 3: Fine-tune DistilBERT (Transformer)
bash
Copy
Edit
python train_transformer.py
Loads distilbert-base-uncased

Fine-tunes it using Hugging Face Trainer

Saves model to local folder

⚠️ Model File Not Included
This repository does not contain the fine-tuned model to avoid large file uploads.

🔗 Download model from Google Drive:
Download distilbert-email-feedback-model

Then place the model in the root directory as:

Copy
Edit
distilbert-email-feedback-model/
Step 4: Add Sentiment Scores
bash
Copy
Edit
python sentiment_analysis.py
Adds vader_score, vader_label

Adds Hugging Face sentiment label + score

Saves results to predicted_feedback.csv

Step 5: Test the API (Optional)
Start the FastAPI server (if using):

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
Run the API test:

bash
Copy
Edit
python api_test.py
📈 Sample Output
text	predicted_label	vader_label	huggingface_sentiment
Love the design!	praise	positive	POSITIVE
The app keeps crashing.	technical_issue	negative	NEGATIVE
Can we get dark mode?	feature_request	neutral	NEUTRAL

💡 Key Learning Areas
Text preprocessing with spaCy

Basic ML vs. Transformers for NLP
